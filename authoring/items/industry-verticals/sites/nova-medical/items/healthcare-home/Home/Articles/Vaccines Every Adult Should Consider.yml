        <p>Vaccinations aren’t just for children—adults also benefit from immunizations that prevent serious illnesses. Staying up-to-date protects individuals and their communities, especially those with weakened immune systems. Common adult vaccines include influenza, COVID-19 boosters, Tdap, shingles, and pneumococcal vaccines.</p>
        <p>Your age, health conditions, lifestyle, and travel plans can influence which vaccines are recommended. Primary care providers help patients understand when boosters are due and how vaccines support long-term wellness. Preventive care appointments are an excellent opportunity to review immunization history.</p>
        <p>Nova Health Family Medicine offers comprehensive vaccination support, including counseling, reminders, and convenient scheduling. Our goal is to keep adults healthy through proactive prevention.</p>
