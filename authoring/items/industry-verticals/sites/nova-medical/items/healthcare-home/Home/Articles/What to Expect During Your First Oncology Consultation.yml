        <p>A cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming, and knowing what to expect during your first oncology consultation can make the experience more manageable. Oncologists begin by reviewing your medical history, pathology reports, imaging, and diagnostic tests to understand your condition thoroughly. This initial visit focuses on gathering information and building trust.</p>
        <p>Patients will discuss treatment options, which may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical approaches, targeted therapies, or participation in clinical trials. The oncology team also answers questions about timelines, side effects, and support resources. This is an opportunity to establish a collaborative partnership with your care team.</p>
        <p>Nova Health Oncology emphasizes compassionate communication and individualized treatment planning. We ensure every patient leaves their first appointment with clarity, support, and a plan for the next steps.</p>
