        <p>Emily, a lifelong volleyball enthusiast, first noticed wrist pain after a weekend tournament. She tried rest and ice, but her symptoms worsened, making everyday activities uncomfortable. Unsure whether to push through the pain or seek help, she turned to Nova Health’s conversational search tool, which guided her toward specialized orthopedic care.</p>
        <p>After meeting with an orthopedic specialist and undergoing imaging, Emily learned she had a ligament strain that required structured treatment—not rest alone. With a personalized recovery plan including physical therapy, bracing, and gradual strength-building, she began to regain mobility and confidence.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, Emily was back on the court—stronger, pain-free, and grateful for the seamless journey from symptom to diagnosis to recovery. Her experience highlights the power of early evaluation, clear care pathways, and AI-enabled navigation tools that help patients make informed decisions.</p>
