        <p>Orthopedic specialists play a key role in diagnosing sports injuries and determining the right treatment path. Their evaluation begins with a detailed medical history, including how the injury occurred and what symptoms the patient is experiencing. This helps clinicians understand the root cause and severity.</p>
        <p>Diagnostic imaging such as X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI may be used to assess soft tissue injuries, fractures, or joint instability. These tools allow specialists to create accurate treatment plans that support long-term recovery. Many sports injuries benefit from early intervention to prevent further damage.</p>
        <p>Nova Health’s orthopedic team emphasizes patient education, helping individuals understand their diagnosis and treatment options. Through personalized care plans, specialists guide patients back to activity safely and confidently.</p>
